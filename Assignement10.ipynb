    "1)Specifying a specific exception type:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you specify a specific exception type, such as ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, or FileNotFoundError, the except block will only handle exceptions of that particular type or its derived types. It allows you to provide tailored exception handling for the specific exception, including specific error messages or recovery actions. This approach is generally considered more precise and safer since you explicitly handle known exceptions.\n",

    "2)Using a bare except block:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a bare except block without specifying any exception type, it acts as a catch-all for any exception that may occur within the try block. It will handle any type of exception, regardless of its specific type. This approach can be useful when you want to provide a general handling mechanism for all exceptions, such as logging the error, displaying a generic error message, or performing some cleanup actions. However, it is generally discouraged to use a bare except block because it can mask errors and make it harder to identify and debug specific issues in your code."
