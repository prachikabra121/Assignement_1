    "1.Debugging and Troubleshooting: Logging allows developers to track the flow of a program and capture relevant information about its execution. It helps in identifying and understanding issues, errors, and unexpected behavior. By logging specific messages at critical points in the code, developers can effectively diagnose problems and trace their origins.\n",

It enables developers to analyze and fix issues more easily by providing insights into the context and conditions under which exceptions occur.\n",

By analyzing log data, developers can identify bottlenecks, optimize code, and improve the overall performance of the software system.\n",

    "4.Auditing and Compliance: Logging is valuable for auditing and compliance purposes. It provides a record of important events, user actions, and system activities. This information can be used for security audits, regulatory compliance, and forensic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Maintenance and Continuous Improvement: Logs serve as a historical record of a software system's behavior. They help in maintaining and evolving the system by providing insights into usage patterns, identifying recurring issues, and tracking changes over time. Logs can guide decision-making for future enhancements, bug fixes, and system updates.\n",

    "WARNING: This log level is used for potentially harmful or unexpected events that do not necessarily lead to program failure. It indicates that there may be an issue or a condition that requires attention. Example usage: Warnings about deprecated features, non-critical failures, or unusual but recoverable conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERROR: This log level is used to report errors that prevent the program from functioning correctly. It indicates a problem that may require immediate attention. Example usage: Reporting critical failures, exceptions, or unexpected conditions that impact the program's functionality.\n",

    "CRITICAL: This log level is used for very severe errors or failures that may lead to application termination. It indicates a critical situation that requires immediate action. Example usage: Reporting fatal errors, severe exceptions, or situations where the program cannot continue execution.\n",

    "The logging and print statements in Python serve different purposes and have distinct features. Here are the main differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Destination: The print statement outputs the messages to the standard output (usually the console or terminal), while the logging module provides flexibility to direct the log messages to various destinations, such as files, email, databases, or external logging services. This makes logging suitable for capturing and storing log information in a controlled and centralized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Granularity and Control: With print statements, you have limited control over the level of detail or granularity of the output. It is typically used for quick debugging or temporary information. On the other hand, the logging module allows you to define different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and selectively control the verbosity of log messages. This granularity enables you to filter and manage log messages based on their importance, making logging suitable for long-term application monitoring, debugging, and production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Flexibility: The logging module offers extensive configuration options, including log levels, loggers, handlers, formatters, and filters. This flexibility allows you to customize the logging behavior based on your application's specific needs. With print statements, you have limited options for controlling the output format or filtering based on log levels or other criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Persistence and Longevity: print statements are transient and do not persist beyond the current execution. Once the program ends or the console output scrolls off the screen, the print statements are lost. Logging, however, provides a means to capture and store log messages persistently, allowing you to review and analyze them later. This is crucial for debugging, auditing, monitoring, and long-term maintenance of the application."

    "Production Environments: In production environments, where you need to monitor the application, detect and investigate errors, and capture important events or exceptions, logging becomes essential. It allows you to log relevant information at different log levels, capture stack traces, and store log messages for future analysis.\n",
