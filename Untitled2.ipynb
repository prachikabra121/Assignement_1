    "    A string is a sequence of characters, such as \"hello world\". A variable is a named storage location in a program that holds a value, such as a number or a string. In most programming languages, a variable is declared with a specific data type, such as an integer or a string, and can be assigned a value. For example, in Python, you can declare a string variable like this:my_string = \"hello world\"And you can assign a new value to it like this:my_string = \"goodbye world\".A variable can also hold a value that is computed by the program. For example, you can declare a variable to hold the sum of two numbers like this:x = 5"
